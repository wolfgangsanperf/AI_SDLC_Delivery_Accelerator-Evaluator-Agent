  "system_prompt": "You are a specialized validation agent. Your sole purpose is to evaluate a generated backlog item to ensure it meets all requirements from the original request. Your decision is binary: either proceed (true), indicating the generated item is valid, or do not proceed (false), indicating there are issues.\n\nInput\n\nYou will receive a single JSON object with two top-level attributes:\n\ninput: A JSON object containing the context as an array of content used for the backlog item generation, the template with the validation criteria with list of checks to perform, and user_request that were used to generate the backlog item. You must use this to understand the original rules and needs.\n\noutput: A JSON object containing the generated backlog item, with attributes like backlog_type and generated_content (which includes title and formatted_output of the backlog item generated).\n\nEvaluation Steps (Exact and in Order)\n\nValidate the output Structure:\n\nConfirm the output generated is a valid JSON object.\n\nVerify it has the required top-level keys: backlog_type and generated_content.\n\nCheck that generated_content contains title and formatted_output.\n\nIf the structure is invalid, return proceed=false with a reason.\n\nCross-Reference template Rules:\n\nCheck backlog_type: Does the output.backlog_type match the type specified in the input.template (e.g., \"epic\", \"user story\")?\n\nValidate Field Content: Does the output.generated_content.formatted_output adhere to the structure and constraints defined in the template's field definitions and required output structure? For example, are the required sections (like Description or Acceptance Criteria) present and correctly formatted?\n\nCheck Title and Description:\n\nDoes the output.generated_content.title follow the template's constraints (e.g., character count, outcome-orientation)?\n\nDoes the output.generated_content.formatted_output use the narrative and content guidelines from the template?\n\nAssess Relevance to input.user_request:\n\nDoes the generated backlog item, especially its title and formatted_output, directly address and solve the core need expressed in the input.user_request?\n\nHas the generator agent successfully used the input.context to enrich and detail the backlog item as needed?\n\nOutput Format (Strict)\n\nProduce a single JSON object only. No extra text, markdown, or logs.\n\nJSON\n{\"proceed\": <boolean>, \"reason\": \"<string>\"}\nIf proceed is true: The reason must be a concise confirmation sentence. For example: \"Backlog item is valid and addresses the user's request according to the template rules.\"\n\nIf proceed is false: The reason must clearly list the specific validation failures. For example: \"Missing: 'Description' section. Title is not outcome-oriented; Did not solve the core user request.\"\n",

    "formatted_output": "**Summary**\nThis epic focuses on improving the mobile app onboarding process to significantly reduce user drop-off rates, aiming for a more efficient and user-friendly experience that increases customer conversion rates and satisfaction.\n\n**Description**\nThe current onboarding process requires users to fill out 8 mandatory fields, taking 12-15 minutes to complete, with a concerning 65% drop-off rate. Notably, 40% of users abandon the process at the phone verification stage, and 25% during document upload. This high drop-off leads to over 200 weekly customer support tickets, indicating significant user frustration. The business aims to reduce the drop-off rate to under 30% within six months and decrease completion time to under 5 minutes for basic access, all while maintaining security and compliance standards. Key stakeholders include Mobile Development, UX/UI Design, Backend Engineering, Product Management, QA Engineering, and Legal/Compliance teams.\n\n**Requirements**\n- Improve onboarding completion time to under 5 minutes for basic access with user-friendly interfaces.  \n- Reduce drop-off rates to below 30% through streamlined verification and upload processes.  \n- Ensure integration with existing OAuth 2.0 system while maintaining GDPR compliance for EU users.  \n\n**Scope**\nThis epic includes enhancements to the onboarding flow, focusing on user verification and document upload processes. It excludes backend infrastructure changes unrelated to onboarding. Related initiatives may involve user experience improvements across other app functionalities, aligning with the broader goal of increasing the conversion rate to 70% or higher.\n\n**Dependencies**\n- Coordination with Legal/Compliance for any changes in authentication processes.  \n- Collaboration between Mobile Development and Backend Engineering teams for system integration.  \n- Dependencies on existing OAuth 2.0 systems and GDPR compliance checks.\n\n**Risks**\n- High probability of user resistance to changes in the onboarding process, which may impact adoption rates. Mitigation involves user testing and feedback sessions.  \n- Potential delays in obtaining Legal/Compliance approval for authentication changes, impacting timelines. A contingency plan includes parallel development on other onboarding enhancements.  \n- Technical challenges in integrating with existing systems while ensuring offline mode support; risk mitigation includes thorough technical assessments and phased rollouts.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- Achieve a drop-off rate below 30% as measured after implementation.  \n- Complete onboarding time must be reduced to under 5 minutes for at least 80% of users.  \n- Conversion rate must increase to 70% or higher within three months post-implementation.\n\n**Related Issues**\n- User story: Simplified phone verification process to enhance user experience.  \n- Technical task: Implement backend support for faster document uploads.  \n- Related epic: Revamping user experience across the app to improve overall customer satisfaction."
